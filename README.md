Coolpay Integration API

Scenario
----------

Coolpay is a new company that allows to easily send money to friends through their API.
 
You work for Fakebook, a successful social network. Youâ€™ve been tasked to integrate Coolpay inside Fakebook. A/B tests show that users prefer to receive money than pokes!
 
You can find Coolpay documentation here: http://docs.coolpayapi.apiary.io/
 
You will write a small app that uses Coolplay API in a language of your choice. The app should be able do the following:
 
- Authenticate to Coolpay API
- Add recipients
- Send them money
- Check whether a payment was successful

Create the war file that will be deployed under Tomcat.

I used postman as HTTP client for testing the API.
